```rust
let author: &'static blog::Author = blog::author();

println!("{}", author.introduction());
```

I'm Matt "`@bitwizeshift`" Rodusek, a software developer from Waterloo, Ontario.

I'm a [Go][golang] software developer by day at [Verily], a Rust enthusiest by
night, and a (retired?) C++ expert and template meta-programmer.
When I see a problem that does not yet have a solution, I develop it --
and try to release it to the open-source community (where possible) through my
[Github]. Overall, I'm motivated by overcoming
fun and challenging obstacles.

I'm the author of several neat projects, including:

* [`BackportCpp`](https://github.com/bitwizeshift/backportcpp): An ongoing
  effort to backport the best features from `c++14`, `c++17`, and `c++20` to be
  functional in `c++11` and compliant to spec

* [`Result`](https://github.com/bitwizeshift/result): A `result` type similar to
  those found in modern languages like `Rust` or `Swift`

* [`actions-github`](https://github.com/bitwizeshift/actions-github): A repo of
  composite actions wrapping basic Github API calls that otherwise are not
  provided by official actions -- great for repository automation.

Take a look at my [Github] to really see what I'm about!

When I'm not working on my open-source work or blogging, you might find me
answering questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1678770)
where my top tags are `c++` and `language-lawyer`.

## Support

It's difficult finding time to contribute high-quality changes to open-source
projects as all of this has to be done during my spare time. Even these blog
posts have to be done during what little time I have available to contribute.

This is why **your support is important and can make a difference**.

If you like this blog, like and use my work in any real-world products, or
even just want to help support me -- please consider becoming
[a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bitwizeshift), or even just
[buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/dsq3XCcBE)
which will allow me to spend more time on the projects you love.

**Thank you.**
