If you like this blog, like and use my work in any real-world products, or
even just want to help support me -- please consider becoming
[a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bitwizeshift), or even just
[buying me a coffee â˜•](https://buymeacoffee.com/dsq3XCcBE)
which will allow me to spend more time on the projects you love!

In the future, after I acquire sponsors, I will use this page as my
"Hall of Fame" to thank each and every one of you who have helped support my
articles and open source efforts -- both past and present. I want everyone to
know just how much any support means to me -- no matter how small.

**Thank you** ðŸ’–
