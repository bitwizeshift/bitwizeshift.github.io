If you like this blog, like and use my work in any real-world products, or
even just want to help support me -- please consider becoming
[a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bitwizeshift), or even just
[buying me a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è](https://buymeacoffee.com/dsq3XCcBE)
which will allow me to spend more time on the projects you love!

In the future, if and/or when I acquire sponsors, I will dedicate this page to
thank each and every one of you who have helped support my articles and open
source efforts -- both past and present. I want everyone to know just how much
any support means to me.

**Thank you** üíñ
