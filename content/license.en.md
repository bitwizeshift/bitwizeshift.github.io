Unless otherwise specified, I release all software and code snippets I write
under the very permissive [Boost Software License](https://www.boost.org/users/license.html).

This license has very little limitations. It gives full support for authors to
adapt, modify, and use either commercially or non-commercially as they see fit
-- provided that the origin of the software is not misrepresented. This license
does not require any attribution to be made in the final compiled product, but
requires attribution to be retained in source redistributions.
