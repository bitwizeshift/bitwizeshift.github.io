```

I'm Matthew `@bitwizeshift` Rodusek, a software developer from Waterloo, Ontario.
I am an embedded developer by day, C++ template meta-programmer by
night. When I see a problem that does not yet have a solution, I develop it --
and try to release it to the open-source community (where possible) through my
[GitHub](https://github.com/bitwizeshift).

I'm the author of several neat projects, including:

* [`BackportCpp`](https://github.com/bitwizeshift/backportcpp): An ongoing
  effort to backport the best features from `c++14`, `c++17`, and `c++20` to be
  functional in `c++11` and compliant to spec

* [`Result`](https://github.com/bitwizeshift/result): A `result` type similar to
  those found in modern languages like `Rust` or `Swift`

Take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/bitwizeshift) to really see what
I'm about.

When I'm not working on my open-source work or blogging, you might find me
answering questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1678770)
where my top tags are `c++` and `language-lawyer`.

## Support

It's difficult finding time to contribute high-quality changes to open-source
projects as all of this has to be done during my spare time. Even these blog
posts have to be done during what little time I have available to contribute.

This is why **your support is important and can make a difference**.

If you like this blog, like and use my work in any real-world products, or
even just want to help support me -- please consider
[becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bitwizeshift)
which will allow me to spend more time on the projects you love.

**Thank you.**
