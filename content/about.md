## About this Blog

```cpp

const auto blog = Blog{"bitwizeshift.github.io"};
std::cout << blog.details();

```

This blog will be a collection of my professional experiences, advice, and
suggestions for working effectively with C++ -- with an emphasis on template
metaprogramming.

There are several segments that I intend to introduce when I have time,
including:

* Template metaprogramming tips and tricks
* How to wrap poorly-designed APIs into something more usable
* Esoteric features of the C++ language
* Language-agnostic software design practices

Hi, my name is Matthew, and I write this blog.

I am an embedded software developer by day, C++ template meta-programmer by
night. I write C++ libraries that I feel would benefit the community in my spare
time, and release them open-source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/bitwizeshift).

In my spare time, I'm either working on cool projects, answering `c++` and
`language-lawyer` tagged questions on stack-overflow, or I am writing up new
blog entries for here!

If you like this blog, or any of my work -- please consider contributing to me
through Github Sponsors!
