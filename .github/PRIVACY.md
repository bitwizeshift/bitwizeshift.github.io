# Private Policy

This blog does not log, collect, process, or share any personal or user data
in any way. There are no analytics being collected in any way.

In short: I don't track you or don't profile you. **Period.*

-----

However, it is important to note that **Github**, which hosts this blog,
*does* collect some aggregated metrics for the blog via repository interactions
such as clones, views, stars, etc. -- which *are* visible to contributors.

I don't personally care for this data, but it does exist.

You can read more about this in [Github's Privacy Policy].
