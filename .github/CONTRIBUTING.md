# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our blog! Admittedly, I don't
expect any contributions for a personal blog -- but I sincerely appreciate
your enthusiasm, eagerness, and overall support.

This page will outline general contribution guidelines for my blog.

## Guest Blog Posts

At this time, I do not accept guest blog post entries. However, I value your
ideas and encourage you to share your thoughts and suggestions via the blog's
repository [Discussions].

This way, we can discuss potential topics, collaborations, or any other relevant
ideas you may have. From there we can discuss possible guest posts.

## Theme Fixes

This blog uses a forked version of the `hugo-notepadium` theme, which can be
found in [this repository](https://github.com/bitwizeshift/hugo-notepadium).
If there are issues with the theme in any way, please create an issue in that
repository instead.

Most issues relating to styling, accessibility, etc should be directed to that
repository.

## Local Fixes

I welcome contributions related to fixing local styling/overrides on this blog.
If you've identified an issue or have a suggestion for improvement, please follow
these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Issue**: Before making any changes, open an issue to
  discuss the specifics of the theme or styling fix you have in mind. This
  allows me to ensure that your proposed changes align with my vision for the
  blog and to provide feedback or suggestions.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: After discussing this via the Github issue, make
  the changes in your forked repository, submit a pull request to this main
  repository. Ensure that you provide a clear description of the changes made
  and reference the related GitHub Issue (Preferably using the [auto-close syntax])

[auto-close syntax]: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!
